# Run MATLAB Tests

Run all tests in a MATLAB project and generate test artifacts. MATLAB includes
any files in your project that have a Test label. If your pipeline does not
leverage a MATLAB project, then MATLAB includes all tests in the the root of
your repository including its subfolders.

This is a placeholder README. The final README is currently be written (as it is
also the documentation).
